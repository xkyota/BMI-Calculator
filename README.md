# BMI-Calculator

A simple C program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on the user's weight and height.

Functionality
The program prompts the user to input:

- Weight (kg): Body weight in kilograms.
- Height (m): Height in meters.
  It then calculates BMI using the formula:
  BMI = Weight (kg) / (Height (m) \* Height (m))
